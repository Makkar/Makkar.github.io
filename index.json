The $X_i$'s are called the partition sets.\nFor example, if $X = \\mathbb{R}$, then $X$ can be partitioned as $$ X = \\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}}[n, n+1) $$\nBinary Relation A binary relation, or simply relation, $R$, in the set $X$ is a subset of $X \\times X$.\nFor $x, y \\in X$, we denote the fact $(x,y) \\in R$ by writing $x R y$. A function may be defined as a special kind of binary relation.\nEquivalence relation Let\u0026rsquo;s assume that a partition of our non-empty set $X$ is given, and we associate with this partition a relation, $\\sim$, in $X$ defined as follows: $x \\sim y$ if $x$ and $y$ belong to the same partition set. It can easily checked that the relation $\\sim$ satisfies:\n $x \\sim x$ for every $x \\in X$ (reflexivity); $x \\sim y \\implies y \\sim x$ (symmetry); $x \\sim y$ and $y \\sim z$ $\\implies$ $x \\sim z$ (transitivity).  Any relation in $X$ which possesses these three properties is called an equivalence relation in $X$.\nExamples  Let $X = \\mathbb{Z}$ and let $x \\sim y$ if $2 | x-y$ for $x,y \\in X$. Then clearly $\\sim$ is an equivalence relation in $X$. Let $X$, $Y$ be any non-empty sets and $f$ be a mapping from $X$ onto $Y$. Let $x \\sim y$ if $f(x) = f(y)$ for $x,y \\in A$. This defines an equivalence relation in $X$. Indeed, $f(x) = f(x)$, and so $x \\sim x$. If $f(x) = f(y)$ then $f(y) = f(x)$, and so $x \\sim y \\implies y \\sim x$. Finally, if $f(x) = f(y)$ and $f(y) = f(z)$ then $f(x) = f(z)$, and so $x \\sim y$ and $y \\sim z$ $\\implies$ $x \\sim z$. The first example is a special case of this one if we take $X = \\mathbb{Z}$, $Y = \\{0,1\\}$ and $f(x) = x \\mod 2$.  \u0026ldquo;Relation\u0026rdquo; to partition We have just seen that each partition of $X$ has associated with it a natural equivalence relation in $X$. Let us now reverse the situation and show that a given equivalence relation in $X$ determines a natural partition of $X$.\nLet $\\sim$ be an equivalence relation in $X$. For every $x \\in X$ define the set $$ [x] := \\{ y \\in X : y \\sim x\\} $$ called the equivalence set of $x$. We show that the class of all distinct equivalence sets forms a partition of $X$.\nBy reflexivity, $x \\in [x]$ for every $x \\in X$, and thus each equivalence set is non-empty and their union is $X$. We now need to show that any two equivalence sets $[x_1]$ and $[x_2]$ are either disjoint or identical. We prove this by showing that if $[x_1]$ and $[x_2]$ are not disjoint then they are identical. To this end, let $z$ be a common element of $[x_1]$ and $[x_2]$. Let $y$ be any element of $[x_1]$. Using transitivity, $$ y \\sim x_1 \\sim z \\sim x_2 $$ Therefore, $y \\in [x_2]$. Since $y$ was an arbitrary element of $[x_1]$, we get $[x_1] \\subseteq [x_2]$. We can similarly show that $[x_2] \\subseteq [x_1]$. In short, $[x_1] = [x_2]$.\nWe have shown that there is no real distinction between partitions of a set and equivalence relations in the set. They are two \u0026ldquo;equivalent\u0026rdquo; approaches for the same mathematical idea. The approach we choose in an application depends entirely on our own convenience.\n","date":1592695005,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592695005,"objectID":"d1bbc0efd74ed683d7616f54612bc205","permalink":"https://makkar.github.io/post/equivalence-relations/","publishdate":"2020-06-20T19:16:45-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/equivalence-relations/","section":"post","summary":"I want to show how these two concepts are a single mathematical idea.","tags":[],"title":"Partitions and Equivalence Relations","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Preliminaries In the spirit of keeping this article fairly independent and establishing a common notation, let\u0026rsquo;s review some preliminaries.\nDefinition: Suppose $S$ is an ordered set, and $E \\subset S$. If there exists a $\\beta \\in S$ such that $x \\leq \\beta$ for every $x \\in E$, we say that $E$ is bounded above, and call $\\beta$ an upper bound of $E$.\nLower bounds are defined in the same way with $\\geq$ in place of $\\leq$.\nDefinition: Suppose $S$ is an ordered set, $E \\subset S$, and $E$ is bounded above. Suppose there exists an $\\alpha \\in S$ with the following properties:\n $\\alpha$ is an upper bound of $E$. If $\\gamma \u0026lt; \\alpha$ then $\\gamma$ is not an upper bound of $E$.  Then $\\alpha$ is called the least upper bound of $E$ or the supremum of $E$, and we write $$ \\alpha = \\sup E $$ That there is at most one supremum is clear from the property 2 above. The greatest lower bound, or infimum, of a set $E$ which is bounded below is defined in the same manner, and we write it as $\\inf E$.
