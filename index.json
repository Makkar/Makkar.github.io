The $X_i$'s are called the partition sets.\nFor example, if $X = \\mathbb{R}$, then $X$ can be partitioned as $$ X = \\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}}[n, n+1) $$\nBinary Relation A binary relation, or simply relation, $R$, in the set $X$ is a subset of $X \\times X$.\nFor $x, y \\in X$, we denote the fact $(x,y) \\in R$ by writing $x R y$. A function may be defined as a special kind of binary relation.\nEquivalence relation Let\u0026rsquo;s assume that a partition of our non-empty set $X$ is given, and we associate with this partition a relation, $\\sim$, in $X$ defined as follows: $x \\sim y$ if $x$ and $y$ belong to the same partition set. It can easily checked that the relation $\\sim$ satisfies:\n $x \\sim x$ for every $x \\in X$ (reflexivity); $x \\sim y \\implies y \\sim x$ (symmetry); $x \\sim y$ and $y \\sim z$ $\\implies$ $x \\sim z$ (transitivity).  Any relation in $X$ which possesses these three properties is called an equivalence relation in $X$.\nExamples  Let $X = \\mathbb{Z}$ and let $x \\sim y$ if $2 | x-y$ for $x,y \\in X$. Then clearly $\\sim$ is an equivalence relation in $X$. Let $X$, $Y$ be any non-empty sets and $f$ be a mapping from $X$ onto $Y$. Let $x \\sim y$ if $f(x) = f(y)$ for $x,y \\in A$. This defines an equivalence relation in $X$. Indeed, $f(x) = f(x)$, and so $x \\sim x$. If $f(x) = f(y)$ then $f(y) = f(x)$, and so $x \\sim y \\implies y \\sim x$. Finally, if $f(x) = f(y)$ and $f(y) = f(z)$ then $f(x) = f(z)$, and so $x \\sim y$ and $y \\sim z$ $\\implies$ $x \\sim z$. The first example is a special case of this one if we take $X = \\mathbb{Z}$, $Y = \\{0,1\\}$ and $f(x) = x \\mod 2$.  \u0026ldquo;Relation\u0026rdquo; to partition We have just seen that each partition of $X$ has associated with it a natural equivalence relation in $X$. Let us now reverse the situation and show that a given equivalence relation in $X$ determines a natural partition of $X$.\nLet $\\sim$ be an equivalence relation in $X$. For every $x \\in X$ define the set $$ [x] := \\{ y \\in X : y \\sim x\\} $$ called the equivalence set of $x$. We show that the class of all distinct equivalence sets forms a partition of $X$.\nBy reflexivity, $x \\in [x]$ for every $x \\in X$, and thus each equivalence set is non-empty and their union is $X$. We now need to show that any two equivalence sets $[x_1]$ and $[x_2]$ are either disjoint or identical. We prove this by showing that if $[x_1]$ and $[x_2]$ are not disjoint then they are identical. To this end, let $z$ be a common element of $[x_1]$ and $[x_2]$. Let $y$ be any element of $[x_1]$. Using transitivity, $$ y \\sim x_1 \\sim z \\sim x_2 $$ Therefore, $y \\in [x_2]$. Since $y$ was an arbitrary element of $[x_1]$, we get $[x_1] \\subseteq [x_2]$. We can similarly show that $[x_2] \\subseteq [x_1]$. In short, $[x_1] = [x_2]$.\nWe have shown that there is no real distinction between partitions of a set and equivalence relations in the set. They are two \u0026ldquo;equivalent\u0026rdquo; approaches for the same mathematical idea. The approach we choose in an application depends entirely on our own convenience.\n","date":1592695005,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592695005,"objectID":"d1bbc0efd74ed683d7616f54612bc205","permalink":"https://makkar.github.io/post/equivalence-relations/","publishdate":"2020-06-20T19:16:45-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/equivalence-relations/","section":"post","summary":"I want to show how these two concepts are a single mathematical idea.","tags":[],"title":"Partitions and Equivalence Relations","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1592597042,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592597042,"objectID":"f666c79c96acdb6b8a4da2a4c84b4d24","permalink":"https://makkar.github.io/blog/blah-bloh/","publishdate":"2020-06-19T16:04:02-04:00","relpermalink":"/blog/blah-bloh/","section":"blog","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Blah Bloh","type":"blog"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"$$ \\newcommand{\\R}{\\mathbb{R}} \\newcommand{\\RR}{\\overline{\\mathbb{R}}} \\newcommand{\\Q}{\\mathbb{Q}} \\newcommand{\\N}{\\mathbb{N}} \\newcommand{\\Z}{\\mathbb{Z}} \\newcommand{\\e}{\\epsilon} \\newcommand{\\limm}{\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}} \\newcommand{\\lims}{\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty}} \\newcommand{\\limi}{\\liminf_{n \\to \\infty}} \\newcommand{\\sn}{\\{s_n\\}} \\newcommand{\\snk}{\\{s_{n_k}\\}} \\newcommand{\\supk}{\\sup_{k \\geq n}} \\newcommand{\\infk}{\\inf_{k \\geq n}} \\newcommand{\\sups}{\\sup_{k \\geq n} s_k} \\newcommand{\\infs}{\\inf_{k \\geq n} s_k} \\newcommand{\\cc}{\\mathsf{c}} $$\nMost of what follows is taken from Rudin\u0026rsquo;s Principles of Mathematical Analysis.\nIntroduction The concept of upper and lower limits (commonly denoted by $\\limsup$ and $\\liminf$ respectively) shows up routinely when discussing the limiting behaviour of a sequence. For example, consider the Big O notation, $\\mathcal{O}$, defined as $f(n) = \\mathcal{O}(g(n))$ iff there exists a positive real number $c$ and an integer $N$ such that for every $n \\in \\Z$, $n \u0026gt; N$, we have $|f(n)| \\leq c g(n)$. This can be succinctly written as $$ \\lims \\frac{|f(n)|}{g(n)} \u0026lt; \\infty $$\nIn this post, I aim to expound on the concept of upper and lower limits so that the second formulation of Big O notation above becomes easier to understand than the first one.\nDefinitions I start with some definitions.\nDefinition 1: A sequence is function defined on the set $\\N$ of positive integers. If $f(n) = x_n$, for $n \\in \\N$, we denote the sequence $f$ by the symbol $\\{x_n\\}$, or sometimes by $x_1, x_2, \\ldots$.\nDefinition 2: A sequence $\\{p_n\\}$ in a metric space $X$ is said to converge if there is a point $p \\in X$ with the following property: For every $\\e \u0026gt; 0$ there is an integer $N$ such that $n \\geq N$ implies that $d(p_n, p) \u0026lt; \\e$. We write this as $\\limm p_n = p$ or as $p_n \\to p$.\nDefinition 3: Let $\\{s_n\\}$ be a sequence of real numbers with the following property: For every real $M$ there is an integer $N$ such that $n \\geq N$ implies $s_n \\geq M$. We then write $s_n \\to +\\infty$. Similarly for $s_n \\to -\\infty$.\nNote: The symbol $\\to$ is now used for certain type of divergent sequences as well.\nDefinition 4: Given a sequence $\\{p_n\\}$, consider a sequence $\\{n_k\\}$ of positive integers, such that $n_1 \u0026lt; n_2 \u0026lt; \\cdots$. Then the sequence $\\{p_{n_k}\\}$, which is a composition of the functions $\\{n_k\\}$ and $\\{p_n\\}$, is called a subsequence of ${p_n}$. If $\\{p_{n_k}\\}$ converges, its limit is called a subsequential limit of $\\{p_n\\}$.\nDefinition 5: Let $\\sn$ be a sequence of real numbers. Let $E$ be the set of numbers $x$ (in the extended real number system, i.e. $x \\in \\RR := \\R \\cup \\{+\\infty, -\\infty\\}$) such that $s_{n_k} \\to x$ for some subsequence $\\{s_{n_k}\\}$. Therefore, this set contains all the subsequential limits of $\\sn$ plus possibly the numbers $+\\infty$ and $-\\infty$. We define $$ s^* = \\sup E $$ $$ s_* = \\inf E $$ The numbers $s^*$ and $s_*$ are called the upper and lower limits of $\\sn$. We use the notation $$ \\lims s_n = s^* $$ $$ \\limi s_n = s_* $$ It immediately follows that $s_* \\leq s^*$.\nThe fact that $E$ is non-empty (and thus taking $\\sup$ or $\\inf$ makes sense) follows from the observation that either $\\sn$ is bounded or unbounded. If it is bounded then it must contain a convergent subsequence (Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem) and thus at least one element, or if it is unbounded then it must contain either $+\\infty$ or $-\\infty$.\nSome useful lemmas Now let us prove some interesting lemmas that will be useful later.\nLemma 1: The subsequential limits of a sequence $\\{p_n\\}$ in a metric space $X$ form a closed subset of $X$.\nProof: Let $E$ be the set of all subsequential limits of $\\{p_n\\}$ and let $q$ be a limit point of $E$. We have to show that $q \\in E$. To show this we will construct a subsequence of $\\{p_n\\}$ which converges to $q$.\nChoose $n_1$ so that $p_{n_1} \\neq q$. If no such $n_1$ exists, then $E$ has only one element, $q = p_1 = p_2 = \\cdots$, and there is nothing to prove. Define $\\delta = d(q, p_{n_1})$. Suppose $n_1, \\ldots, n_{i-1}$ are chosen. Since $q$ is a limit point of $E$, there is an $x \\in E$ with $d(q, x) \u0026lt; \\frac{\\delta}{2^i}$. Since $x \\in E$, there is an $n_i \u0026gt; n_{i-1}$ such that $d(x, p_{n_i}) \u0026lt; \\frac{\\delta}{2^i}$. Thus $$ d(q, p_{n_i}) \\leq d(q, x) + d(x, p_{n_i}) \u0026lt; \\frac{\\delta}{2^{i-1}} \\quad \\text{for } i = 1,2,\\ldots $$ This implies $p_{n_k} \\to q$, and thus $q \\in E$. $\\square$\nLemma 2: Let $F$ be a nonempty closed set of real numbers which is bounded above. Let $\\alpha = \\sup F$. Then $\\alpha \\in F$.\nProof: Assume for the sake of the contradiction that $\\alpha \\notin F$. Then since $F^\\cc$ is an open set (because $F$ is closed) there exists an $\\e \u0026gt; 0$ such that $(\\alpha - \\e, \\alpha + \\e) \\subset F^\\cc$. But this implies $\\alpha - \\frac{\\e}{2}$ is an upper bound for $F$ which is lower that $\\alpha$. This gives us our required contradiction. $\\square$\nProperties We now have all the tools to prove a very useful characterization of upper and lower limits and the highlight of this post.\nTheorem 1: Let $\\sn$ be a sequence of real numbers. Let $E$ and $s^*$ have the same meaning as in Definition 5. Then $s^*$ has the following two properties:\n $s^* \\in E$. If $x \u0026gt; s^*$, there is an integer $N$ such that $n \\geq N$ implies $s_n \u0026lt; x$.  Moreover, $s^*$ is the only number with these two properties.\nOf course, an analogous result is true for $s_*$.\nProof: We start by showing the two properties.\n  We divide it into three cases depending on what value $s^*$ takes:\nIf $s^* = +\\infty$, then $E$ is not bounded above; hence $\\sn$ is not bounded above, and thus there is a subsequence $\\{s_{n_k}\\}$ such that $s_{n_k} \\to +\\infty$. Therefore, $+\\infty \\in E$ and thus $s^* \\in E$.\nIf $s^*$ is real, then $E$ is bounded above, and at least one subsequential limit exists by the definition of $\\sup$. Therefore, $s^* \\in E$ follows from the Lemmas 1 and 2, and the fact that $s^* = \\sup E$.\nIf $s^* = -\\infty$, then $E$ contains only one element, namely $-\\infty$, and there is no subsequential limit. Thus, $s^* \\in E$.\n  Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there is a number $x \u0026gt; s^*$ such that $s_n \\geq x$ for infinitely many values of $n$. Let\u0026rsquo;s denote this set of $n$'s with $\\mathcal{K}$ and let $\\{s_k\\}$$_{k \\in \\mathcal{K}}$ be this subsequence. If $\\{s_k\\}_{k \\in \\mathcal{K}}$ is unbounded then $s^* = +\\infty$ contradicting the fact that there exists an $x \u0026gt; s^*$. And if $\\{s_k\\}_{k \\in \\mathcal{K}}$ is bounded that it contains a convergent subsequence (Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem). Suppose this convergent subsequence converges to $y$. Then $y \\geq x \u0026gt; s^*$. This contradicts the definition of $s^*$.\n  To show the uniqueness, suppose there are two distinct numbers, $p$ and $q$, which satisfy the two properties, and suppose $p \u0026lt; q$. Choose $x$ such that $p \u0026lt; x \u0026lt; q$. Since $p$ satisfies the second property, we have $s_n \u0026lt; x$ for $n \\geq N$. But then $q$ cannot satisfy the second property. $\\square$\nAn intuitive theorem:\nTheorem 2: If $s_n \\leq t_n$ for $n \\geq N$, where $N \\in \\N$ is fixed, then $$\\limi s_n \\leq \\limi t_n,$$ $$\\lims s_n \\leq \\lims t_n$$\nProof: Let $s^* = \\lims s_n$ and $t^* = \\lims t_n$. Suppose for the sake of contradiction $t^* \u0026lt; s^*$. Choose $x$ such that $t^* \u0026lt; x \u0026lt; s^*$. Then by the second property of Theorem 1 there is an integer $N_1$ such that $n \\geq N_1$ implies $t_n \u0026lt; x$. Also by the first property there exists a subsequence $\\snk$ such that $s_{n_k} \\to s^*$. This implies that there exists an integer $N_2$ such that $n \\geq N_2$ implies $x \u0026lt; s_n$. But then for $n \\geq \\max\\{N_1, N_2\\}$ we have $t_n \u0026lt; x \u0026lt; s_n$. This gives us our required contradiction.\nA similar argument can be made for the $\\liminf$ case. $\\square$\nNext we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence of a sequence in terms of its $\\liminf$ and $\\limsup$.\nTheorem 3: For a real-valued sequence $\\sn$, $\\limm s_n = s \\in \\RR$ if and only if $$\\lims s_n = \\limi s_n = s$$\nProof: We divide the analysis into three cases.\nFirst, let $s \\in \\R$. Then if $\\lims s_n = \\limi s_n = s$, Theorem 1 implies that for any $\\e \u0026gt; 0$ we have $s_n \\in (s-\\e, s+\\e)$ for all but finitely many $n$, which means $s_n \\to s$. On the other hand if $s_n \\to s$ then every subsequence $\\snk$ must converge to $s$ and hence $\\lims s_n = \\limi s_n = s$.\nNow let $s = +\\infty$. Then $s_n \\to s$, i.e., for every $M \\in \\R$ there is an integer $N$ such that $n \\geq N$ implies $s_n \\geq M$ if and only $\\limi s_n = +\\infty$, and then $\\lims s_n = +\\infty$ since $\\limi s_n \\leq \\lims s_n$.\nLastly, let $s = -\\infty$. Then $s_n \\to s$, i.e., for every $M \\in \\R$ there is an integer $N$ such that $n \\geq N$ implies $s_n \\leq M$ if and only $\\lims s_n = -\\infty$, and then $\\limi s_n = -\\infty$ since $\\limi s_n \\leq \\lims s_n$. $\\square$\nUpper and lower limits - a reprise There is an equivalent way to express upper and lower limits.\nDefinition 6: Let $\\sn$ be a sequence of real numbers. We define the notation $$\\sups := \\sup \\{ s_k : k \\geq n\\}$$ $$\\infs := \\inf \\{ s_k : k \\geq n\\}$$\nWe note that the sequence $\\{ \\sups \\}$$_{n \\in \\N}$ is monotonically decreasing and the sequence $\\{ \\infs \\}$$_{n \\in \\N}$ is monotonically increasing, and thus their limits exist in $\\RR$.\nWe now show the equivalence of the two ways of looking at upper and lower limits.\nTheorem 4: Let $\\sn$ be a sequence of real numbers. Then $$\\limm \\sups = \\lims s_n$$ $$\\limm \\infs = \\limi s_n$$\nProof: We will prove the first equation. The proof for the second is similar. We prove the equation in two steps.\nLet $S = \\{ s_n : n \\in \\N \\}$. Let\u0026rsquo;s show that $\\sup S = +\\infty$ if and only if $\\lims s_n = + \\infty$. Suppose first that $\\sup S = + \\infty$. Then we construct a subsequence $\\snk$ as follows. We let $n_1 = 1.$ Suppose $n_1, \\ldots, n_{k}$ are chosen and let $$S_k = \\{ n \\in \\N : s_n \\geq \\max\\{s_{n_1}, \\ldots, s_{n_k}, k\\} + 1 \\}$$ Notice that $S_k$ is infinite as otherwise we can find an $M \\in \\R$ such that $s_n \\leq M$ for all $n \\geq 1$, contradicting the fact that $\\sup S = + \\infty$. We pick $n_{k+1}$ to be the smallest element of $S_k$ which is bigger than $n_k$. The resulting subsequence satisfies the condition that $s_{n_k} \\geq k$ for $k \\geq 2$ and thus we conclude that $s_{n_k} \\to +\\infty$ which gives $\\lims s_n = +\\infty$. Now suppose that $\\lims s_n = +\\infty$. From Theorem 1 we can conclude that there exists a subsequence $\\snk$ such that $s_{n_k} \\to +\\infty$. This immediately implies $\\sup S = +\\infty$.\nFor the second step, suppose $\\sup S \u0026lt; + \\infty$. Let $$a_n = \\sups$$ Notice that $a_1 \u0026lt; +\\infty$ and $\\{a_n\\}$ is a monotonically decreasing sequence. Therefore, we have that either $\\{a_n\\}$ is lower bounded in which case it converges to, say, $a$ or it is not in which case $\\limm a_n = -\\infty$. Since $s_n \\leq a_n$, by Theorem 2 we can conclude $$ \\lims s_n \\leq \\lims a_n = \\limm a_n $$ where the last equality follows from Theorem 3. We will now show that $$ \\lims s_n \\geq \\limm a_n $$ which will give us our required equality. If $\\limm a_n = -\\infty$ there is nothing to prove and so we assume that $a \u0026gt; -\\infty$. Let $\\e \u0026gt; 0$ be given and let $$ B = \\{ n \\in \\N : s_n \\geq a - \\e \\} $$ We claim that $B$ is infinite. Indeed, if $B$ were finite we can find $N \\in \\N$ so that $N \\geq \\max(B)$. This will imply that $s_n \\leq a - \\e$ for all $n \\geq N$ and so $a_n \\leq a - \\e$ for $n \\geq N$. But then by Theorem 2 we would conclude $a = \\limm a_n \\leq a-\\e$, which is absurd. Thus $B$ is infinite and we let $\\snk$ be a subsequence of $\\sn$ with $n_k \\in B$. Notice that $\\lims s_{n_k} \\leq \\lims s_n$, since any subsequential limit of $\\snk$ is also a subsequential limit of $\\sn$. This along with Theorem 2 give $$ a - \\e \\leq \\lims s_{n_k} \\leq \\lims s_n $$ Since $\\e$ was arbitrary we conclude that $\\lims s_n \\geq a$, which is what we wanted. $\\square$\nMore properties These theorems open new avenues to discover more properties of upper and lower limits.\nTheorem 5: Let $\\sn$ be a sequence of real numbers. Then $$\\limi s_n = - \\lims (-s_n)$$\nProof: TODO\nSubadditivity of $\\limsup$:\nTheorem 6: For any two real sequences ${a_n}$ and ${b_n}$, $$ \\lims (a_n + b_n) \\leq \\lims a_n + \\lims b_n $$ provided the sum on the right is not of the form $\\infty - \\infty$.\nProof: If $\\lims a_n = \\infty$ then as by assumption the right side is not $\\infty - \\infty$, it is $\\infty$ and there is nothing to prove. Similarly for the case $\\lims b_n = \\infty$. We may thus assume that $$ \\lims a_n = A \u0026lt; \\infty \\text{ and } \\lims b_n = B \u0026lt; \\infty $$ We note that $\\sup_{k \\geq 1} a_k \u0026lt; \\infty$, $\\sup_{k \\geq 1} b_k \u0026lt; \\infty$, and so TODO\nSuperadditivity of $\\liminf$:\nTheorem 7: For any two real sequences ${a_n}$ and ${b_n}$, $$ \\limi (a_n + b_n) \\geq \\limi a_n + \\limi b_n $$ provided the sum on the right is not of the form $\\infty - \\infty$.\nProof: TODO\n","date":1592426033,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592426033,"objectID":"4fb8d43db098b4713ceef892d1d72774","permalink":"https://makkar.github.io/post/upper-and-lower-limits/","publishdate":"2020-06-17T16:33:53-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/upper-and-lower-limits/","section":"post","summary":"A reference for a useful concept.","tags":[],"title":"Upper and Lower Limits","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Title: Bayesian nonparametric ensemble Date: June 17, 2020 Tags: bayesian Summary: This work improves upon the BNE model of Liu et al.
