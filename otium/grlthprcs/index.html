<p>I have been attending a reading course on stochastic analysis led by <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~ik/">Professor Ioannis Karatzas</a>, where the students take turn in presenting a topic of their choice. I recently presented on Choquet&#39;s theory of capacities and its applications to measure theory and in the general theory of processes. This blog post is based on this presentation. I have freely copied<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fndef:1" class="fnref">[1]</a></sup> from many sources, but my primary reference are the &#40;unfortunately unpublished&#41; lecture notes by Prof. Karatzas.</p>
<h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction" class="header-anchor">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Kolmogorov laid the modern axiomatic foundations of probability theory with the German monograph Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung which appeared in Ergebnisse Der Mathematik in 1933. This was a period of intense discussions on the foundations of probability, and a majority of probabilists at the time considered measure theory not only a waste of time, but also an offense to &quot;probabilistic intuition&quot; <span class="bibref"><a href="#meyer">(Meyer, 2009)</a></span>. But by 1950, with the work of Doob in particular, these discussions of foundations had been settled.</p>
<p>Continuous-time processes, on the other hand, were difficult to tame even with measure theory: if a particle is subject to random evolution, to show that its trajectory is continuous, or bounded, requires that all time values be considered, whereas classical measure theory can only handle a <em>countable</em> infinity of time values. Thus, not only does probability depend on measure theory, but it also requires more of measure theory than the rest of analysis <span class="bibref"><a href="#meyer">(Meyer, 2009)</a></span>.</p>
<p>The missing pieces of the puzzle, which will be the highlight of this and the next blog post, are the debut, section and projection theorems. These theorems are also indispensable in many applications, for instance in dynamic programming and stochastic control <span class="bibref"><a href="#karoui">(Karoui and Tan, 2013)</a></span>.</p>
<p>To get a taste of these theorems, let&#39;s recall a famous error made by Lebesgue in the paper Sur les fonctions représentables analytiquement published in 1905. Consider the measurable space \((\mathbb R^2, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb R^2))\) and the projection map \(\pi\) given by \(\mathbb R^2 \ni (x,y) \mapsto \pi(x,y) = y \in \mathbb R.\) It is easy to see that for any open set \(O\) in \(\mathbb R^2\), the set \(\pi(O)\) is also open in \(\mathbb R\): Recall that the standard topology on \(\mathbb R^2\) is same as the product topology on \(\mathbb R^2.\) By the definition of the product topology on \(\mathbb R^2\), an open set \(O\) in \(\mathbb R^2\) is of the form \(O = \bigcup_{i \in I} \bigcap_{j \in J_i} U_{ij} \times V_{ij}\) for open \(U_{ij}, V_{ij}\) in \(\mathbb R\), \(I\) arbitrary and \(J_i\) finite. A simple argument gives \(\pi(O) = \bigcup_{i \in I} \bigcap_{j \in J_i} U_{ij}\) which is open in \(\mathbb R.\) In fact, more generally, projection from any product space &#40;with product topology&#41; is an open map. Now it seems reasonable to expect that for any Borel set \(B \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb R^2)\) its projection is also a Borel set in \(\mathcal{B}(\mathbb R)\), and Lebesgue assumed this in his paper. But, in fact, this is FALSE&#33; The error was spotted in around 1917 by Mikhail Suslin, who realised that the projection map need not be Borel, and this lead to his investigation of analytic sets and to begin the study of what is now known as descriptive set theory <span class="bibref"><a href="#lowther">(Almost Sure blog)</a></span>.</p>
<p>The problem is projection doesn&#39;t commute with countable decreasing intersection. For example, consider the decreasing sequence of sets \(S_n = (0, 1/n) \times \mathbb R.\) Then \(\pi(S_n) = \mathbb R\) for all \(n\), giving \(\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb N} \pi(S_n) = \mathbb R\), but \(\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb N} S_n = \varnothing\), giving \(\pi \left( \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb N} S_n \right) = \varnothing.\) The measurable projection theorem stated next will be one of the highlights of this post.</p>
<div class="thm"><strong>Measurable Projection Theorem</strong>: Let \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})\) be a complete probability space, let \((K, \mathcal{B}(K))\) be a locally compact separable metric space endowed with the collection of its Borel sets, and denote by \(\pi\) the projection of \(K \times \Omega\) onto \(\Omega.\) Then, for every \(B \in \mathcal{B}(K) \otimes \mathcal{F}\), the projection \(\pi(B) \in \mathcal{F}.\)</div>
<p>Why is proving such results difficult? As mentioned above it&#39;s because projection doesn&#39;t behave nicely with intersections. Nevertheless, let us try to see how one might try to prove the above theorem. A standard approach in measure theory is to construct a collection like <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} \mathscr{E} = \{S \subseteq K \times \Omega\,:\,\pi(S) \in \mathcal{F}\}\end{aligned}\]</div> which contains the sets satisfying the desired property, and show that it is a \(\sigma\)-algebra containing a simple collection, say \(\mathscr{A}\), such that it easy to show that elements of \(\mathscr{A}\) satisfy the desired property and \(\mathscr{A}\) generates \(\mathcal{B}(K) \otimes \mathcal{F}\), because then we will have \(\mathcal{B}(K) \otimes \mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathscr{E}.\) To this end, let <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} \mathscr{A} = \{S \subseteq K \times \Omega\,:\, S = E \times F \text{ for } E \in \mathcal{B}(K),\, F \in \mathcal{F}\}.\end{aligned}\]</div> Then it is easy to see that \(\mathscr{A} \subseteq \mathscr{E}\), \(\mathscr{A}\) generates \(\mathcal{B}(K) \otimes \mathcal{F}\) and that \(\mathscr{A}\) is an algebra. If we could show that \(\mathscr{E}\) is a monotone class, then we would be done on account of monotone class theorem. Increasing sequences are easily handled, in fact if \(\{S_n\} _ {n \in \mathbb N} \subseteq K \times \Omega\) is any sequence, then <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} \pi\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty S_n\right) = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \pi(S_n).\end{aligned}\]</div> But if \(S_1 \supseteq S_2 \supseteq \cdots\), then in general we <em>cannot</em> say <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} \pi\left(\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty S_n\right) = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty \pi(S_n).\end{aligned}\]</div> Enter Choquet&#39;s theory of capacities. It provides the language to prove results like these. We know that every Borel measure \(\mu\) on \(\mathbb R^d\) &#40;in fact, any Polish space&#41; has the <em>interior regularity</em> &#40;also known as <em>tightness</em>&#41; property <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} \mu(B) = \sup_{\substack{K \in \mathscr{K}(\mathbb R^d) \\ K \subseteq B}} \mu(K), \quad \forall \; B \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb R^d),\end{aligned}\]</div> where \(\mathscr{K}(\mathbb R^d)\) is the collection of all compact sets in \(\mathbb R^d.\) The Choquet&#39;s theory of capacities generalizes this approximation-from-below property, and distills those properties of measure that allow for such approximation to hold in very general settings. As we will see, monotonicity and continuity from above and below properties are at play here, and notions corresponding to complements or differences will be absent.</p>
<p>The next few sections will be very abstract and it is easy to lose sight of our goal. Some people enjoy this mental gymnastics, but even if you find this dry, the reward at the end will be worth the initial struggle. We start with Choquet&#39;s theory of capacities. The highlight of this part will be Choquet&#39;s capacitability theorem. To prove this major result we will need to define a lot of new terminology and prove some major results like Sierpiński&#39;s theorem and Sion&#39;s theorem. Armed with Choquet&#39;s capacitability theorem we will prove Measurable Section theorem which in turn will form the backbone of various other results in measure theory. These results in measure theory will then help us prove results in general theory of processes, but we will discuss this part in the <a href="/otium/grlthprcs2">next blog post</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pavings_and_mosaics"><a href="#pavings_and_mosaics" class="header-anchor">Pavings and Mosaics</a></h2>
<div class="def"><strong>Definition 1</strong>: Let \(E\) be a nonempty set. A collection \(\mathcal E\) of subsets of \(E\) is called a <em>paving</em> if it closed under finite unions and finite intersections. The pair \((E, \mathcal E)\) is then called a <em>paved space</em>.</div>
<p>The concept of paving generalizes the concept of algebra. As an example, if \(E\) is a topological space, then the collection of closed subsets of \(E\) forms a paving. As another example, if \(E\) is a Hausdorff space, then \((E, \mathscr K(E))\) is a paved space, where as before \(\mathscr{K}(E)\) denotes the collection of all compact sets in \(E.\)</p>
<p>It is easy to check that an arbitrary intersection of pavings is also a paving, and that the collection \(\mathfrak{P}(E)\) of all subsets of \(E\) is a paving. Thus for any collection \(\mathcal{A}\) of subsets of \(E\), we can define the notion of <em>paving generated by</em> \(\mathcal{A}\) as the smallest paving of subsets of \(E\) that contains \(\mathcal{A}\) by simply defining it to be the intersection of all pavings of \(E\) containing \(\mathcal{A}.\)</p>
<div class="def"><strong>Definition 2</strong>: For two paved spaces \((E,\mathcal{E})\) and \((F,\mathcal{F})\), the <em>product paving of \(\mathcal{E}\) and \(\mathcal{F}\)</em>, denoted by \(\mathcal{E} \otimes_p \mathcal{F}\), is a paving on \(E \times F\) generated by all rectangles \(\mathcal{R} = \{A \times B \,:\, A \in \mathcal{E}, B \in \mathcal{F}\}.\)</div>
<p>Using the fact that \((A_1 \times B_1) \cap (A_2 \times B_2) = (A_1 \cap A_2) \times (B_1 \cap B_2)\) we see that \(\mathcal{R}\) is stable under finite intersections. Therefore, any element of \(\mathcal{E} \otimes_p \mathcal{F}\) is of the form \(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \times B_i\), where \(A_i \in \mathcal{E}\) and \(B_i \in \mathcal{F}\) for all \(i=1,\ldots,n.\)</p>
<div class="def"><strong>Definition 3</strong>: Let \(E\) be a nonempty set. A collection of subsets of \(E\) which is closed under countable unions and countable intersections is called a <em>mosaic</em>.</div>
<p>The concept of mosaic generalizes the concept of \(\sigma\)-algebra. Just like paving, it is easy to define the notion of <em>mosaic generated by a collection</em>. They will always occur in the context of a paving \(\mathcal{E}\) on \(E.\) We denote by \(\widehat{\mathcal{E}}\) the mosaic generated by \(\mathcal{E}.\) \(\mathcal{E}\ \widehat{\otimes}_p \mathcal{F}\) will denote the mosaic generated by the product paving \(\mathcal{E} \otimes_p \mathcal{F}.\)</p>
<p>Just like with monotone class arguments in measure theory, the paving \(\mathcal E\) will be a simple collection of subsets of \(E\) for which it is easy to prove a property \(P.\) From here we will show that the elements of the mosaic \(\widehat{\mathcal E}\) also satisfy \(P.\) Often \(\widehat{\mathcal E}\) will be a \(\sigma\)-algebra.</p>
<p>Henceforth the notation \(\mathcal{E}\) will be used for a paving on \(E.\)</p>
<h3 id="properties_of_pavings_and_mosaics"><a href="#properties_of_pavings_and_mosaics" class="header-anchor">Properties of pavings and mosaics</a></h3>
<p>Just like the results connecting algebra and \(\sigma\)-algebra, we have results connecting pavings and mosaics.</p>
<div class="thm"><strong>Lemma 1</strong>: If \(A \in \mathcal{E}\) implies \(A^\mathsf{c} = E \setminus A \in \widehat{\mathcal{E}}\), then \(\widehat{\mathcal{E}} = \sigma(\mathcal{E}).\)</div>
<div class="proof">Follows immediately from the monotone class theorem.</div>
<p>As an example, if \(E\) is a separable, locally compact metric space, and \(\mathcal{E} = \mathscr{K}(E)\) is the collection of compact subsets of \(E\), then this property holds. In fact, \(E\) can be a second-countable locally compact Hausdorff space. Then it is \(\sigma\)-compact and every compact subset is closed. This implies that the open set given by the complement of a compact set is a countable union of compact sets. Combine it with the fact that an open subset of a locally compact and \(\sigma\)-compact is itself \(\sigma\)-compact to get that if \(A \in \mathcal E\), then \(A^\mathsf{c} \in \widehat{\mathcal E}.\)</p>
<div class="thm"><strong>Lemma 2</strong>: The mosaic \(\widehat{\mathcal{E}}\) is the smallest collection of subsets of \(E\) that contains \(\mathcal{E}\) and is closed under countable increasing unions and under countable decreasing intersections. In other words, if \(\mathcal M(\mathcal{E})\) denotes the monotone class generated by \(\mathcal{E}\), then \(\widehat{\mathcal{E}} = \mathcal M(\mathcal{E}).\)</div>
<div class="proof"><p>Since a mosaic is a monotone class and since \(\mathcal{E} \subseteq \widehat{\mathcal{E}}\), we have \(\mathcal M(\mathcal{E}) \subseteq \widehat{\mathcal{E}}.\) For the other side, we will be done if we show that \(\mathcal M(\mathcal{E})\) is a mosaic, since \(\mathcal{E} \subseteq \mathcal M(\mathcal{E}).\)</p>
<p>The first property to note is that a monotone paving is a mosaic. To see this, let \(\mathcal{R}\) be a monotone paving and \(A_1, A_2, \ldots \in \mathcal{R}.\) Then since \(\mathcal{R}\) is a paving, \(B_n = \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \in \mathcal{R}\) for all \({n \in \mathbb N}.\) But \(\{B_n\}_{n \in \mathbb N}\) is an increasing sequence and \(\mathcal{R}\) is a monotone class, and therefore their union \(\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb N} A_n = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb N} B_n \in \mathcal{R}\), and hence \(\mathcal{R}\) is closed under countable unions. Similarly for countable intersections.</p>
<p>Therefore, we will be done if we show that \(\mathcal M(\mathcal{E})\) is a paving. To this end, for any \(B \subseteq E\), let <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} \mathcal{K}(B) := \{A \subseteq E\,:\, A \cup B,\, A \cap B \in \mathcal M(\mathcal{E})\}.\end{aligned}\]</div> Notice that by symmetry, \(A \in \mathcal{K}(B) \iff B \in \mathcal{K}(A).\) If \(A_1 \subseteq A_2 \subseteq \cdots \in \mathcal{K}(B)\) is an increasing sequence, then <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb N} A_n \cup B &= \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb N} (A_n \cup B) \in \mathcal M(\mathcal{E}) \\
    \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb N} A_n \cap B &= \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb N} (A_n \cap B) \in \mathcal M(\mathcal{E}),\end{aligned}\]</div> and similarly for decreasing sequences. Therefore, if \(\mathcal{K}(B) \neq \varnothing\), then it is a monotone class. If \(A, B \in \mathcal{E}\), then by the definition of a paving, \(A \in \mathcal{K}(B).\) Since this is true for every \(A \in \mathcal{E}\), we have \(\mathcal{E} \subseteq \mathcal{K}(B)\), and \(\mathcal{K}(B)\) is a monotone class containing \(\mathcal{E}.\) Since \(\mathcal M(\mathcal{E})\) is the smallest monotone class containing \(\mathcal{E}\), we have <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} \mathcal M(\mathcal{E}) \subseteq \mathcal{K}(B).\end{aligned}\]</div> Hence if \(A \in \mathcal M(\mathcal{E})\) and \(B \in \mathcal{E}\), then \(A \in \mathcal{K}(B)\), and therefore \(B \in \mathcal{K}(A).\) Since this is true for every \(B \in \mathcal{E}\), it follows that <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} \mathcal M(\mathcal{E}) \subseteq \mathcal{K}(A).\end{aligned}\]</div> The validity of this relation for every \(A \in \mathcal M(\mathcal{E})\) is equivalent to the assertion that \(\mathcal M(\mathcal{E})\) is a paving.</p></div>
<h3 id="compact_pavings"><a href="#compact_pavings" class="header-anchor">Compact pavings</a></h3>
<p>Recall a standard result from topology: a topological space \(X\) is compact if and only if for every collection \(\mathcal C\) of closed subsets of \(X\) having the finite intersection property &#40;i.e., every finite sub-collection of \(\mathcal C\) has nonempty intersection&#41;, the intersection \(\bigcap_{C \in \mathcal C} C\) is nonempty. For our use case, we consider countable sub-collections.</p>
<div class="def"><strong>Definition 4</strong>: Consider an arbitrary collection \(\mathcal A\) of subsets of \(E.\) It is called a <em>compact collection</em> if every countable sub-collection of elements in \(\mathcal A\) having the finite intersection property has non-empty intersection. A paving \(\mathcal{E}\) is a <em>compact paving</em>, if every decreasing sequence of nonempty elements of \(\mathcal{E}\) has a nonempty intersection.</div>
<p>It is easy to verify that a compact paving is a compact collection. As an example, if \(E\) is a separable metric space, the collection, \(\mathscr{K}(E)\), of all compact subsets of \(E\) is a compact paving. This follows immediately from the finite intersection characterization of a compact topological space stated above.</p>
<p>We define <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} \mathcal{E}_\delta := \left\{\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb N} A_n\,:\,A_n \in \mathcal{E} \text{ for all } n \in \mathbb N\right\}\end{aligned}\]</div> and note that if \(\mathcal{E}\) is a compact paving then so is \(\mathcal{E}_\delta.\) Indeed, \(\mathcal{E}_\delta\) is a paving because for \(A = \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb N} A_n\) and \(B = \bigcap_{m \in \mathbb N} B_m\) in \(\mathcal{E}_\delta\), <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} A \cup B &= \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb N} \bigcap_{m \in \mathbb N} (A_n \cup B_m) \in \mathcal{E}_\delta \\
A \cap B &= \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb N} \bigcap_{m \in \mathbb N} (A_n \cap B_m) \in \mathcal{E}_\delta,\end{aligned}\]</div> and \(\mathcal{E}_\delta\) is a compact paving because intersection of a sequence of countable intersections is again a countable intersection.</p>
<p>The next lemma tells us when it acceptable to commute projection with countable intersections.</p>
<div class="thm"><strong>Lemma 3</strong>: Let \(K\) and \(E\) be two nonempty sets, and denote by \(\pi\) the projection of \(K \times E\) onto \(E.\) Suppose that \(\mathcal{H}\) is a paving of subsets of \(K \times E\) with the property that, for every \(x \in E\), the collection \(\mathcal{H}(x) := \{H(x) \,:\, H \in \mathcal{H}\}\) is a compact paving on \(K.\) Here \(H(x) := \{y \in K \,:\, (y,x) \in H\}\) denotes the \(x\)-section of \(H \subseteq K \times E.\) Then, for every decreasing sequence \(\{H_n\} _ {n \in \mathbb N}\) of sets in the paving \(\mathcal{H}_\delta\), we have <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} \pi\left(\bigcap _ {n \in \mathbb N} H_n\right) = \bigcap _ {n \in \mathbb N} \pi(H_n).\end{aligned}\]</div></div>
<div class="proof"><p>\(\pi\left(\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb N} H_n\right) \subseteq \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb N} \pi(H_n)\) is easy to see because if \(x \in \pi\left(\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb N} H_n\right)\) then there exists \((y,x) \in K \times E\) such that \((y,x) \in \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb N} H_n\) which implies \(x \in \pi(H_n)\) for all \(n \in \mathbb N.\)</p>
<p>For the other side, let \(x \in \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb N} \pi(H_n).\) Then the sequence \(\{H_n(x)\}_{n \in \mathbb N}\) is decreasing whose elements are nonempty and they are in \(\mathcal{H}(x)_\delta.\) But since \(\mathcal{H}(x)_\delta\) is a compact paving by assumption, \(\bigcap_n H_n(x)\) must be nonempty, implying \(x \in \pi\left(\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb N} H_n\right).\)</p></div>
<h2 id="envelopes"><a href="#envelopes" class="header-anchor">Envelopes</a></h2>
<div class="def"><strong>Definition 5</strong>: Let \((E, \mathcal{E})\) be a paved space, and fix a subset \(A \subseteq E\) as well as a decreasing sequence \(\{A_k\} _ {k \in \mathbb N} \subseteq \mathfrak{P}(E).\) We say that \(A\) is an <em>\(\mathcal{E}\)-envelope of \(\{A_k\} _ {k \in \mathbb N}\)</em>, if there exists a decreasing sequence \(\{C_k\}_{k \in \mathbb N} \subseteq \mathcal{E} \cup \{E\}\) such that <a id="env" class="anchor"></a>\[\begin{aligned}

<ol>
<li><p>Let \(E\) be a separable metric space, and \(\mathcal{E}\) be the paving consisting of all closed subsets of \(E.\) Then a subset \(A\) of \(E\) is an \(\mathcal{E}\)-envelope of a given decreasing sequence \(\{A_k\} _ {k \in \mathbb N} \subseteq \mathfrak{P}(E)\) if, and only if, \(A\) contains \(\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb N} \overline{A}_k\), the intersection of the closures of the sets \(A_k, k \in \mathbb N\) in the sequence. Indeed, that \(A\) is an \(\mathcal{E}\)-envelope of \(\{A_k\} _ {k \in \mathbb N}\) &#40;with the existence of a sequence \(\{C_k\}_{k \in \mathbb N}\) as in Definition 5 above&#41; implies \(A\) contains \(\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb N} \overline{A}_k\) follows from the observation that \(\overline{A}_k \subseteq C_k\) for each \(k \in \mathbb N\), while the other side is easy to see if we let \(C_k = \overline{A}_k\) for each \(k \in \mathbb N.\)</p>
</li>
<li><p>An abstract version of the example above: Let \((E, \mathcal{E})\) be a paved space; for every subset \(A\) of \(E\), introduce the collection of sets \(\mathcal{A} := \{B \in \mathcal{E} \cup \{E\} \,:\, A \subseteq B\}\) and assume that the intersection \(\overline{A} := \bigcap_{B \in \mathcal{A}} B\), called the <em>adherent of \(A\) in the paving \(\mathcal{E}\)</em>, belongs to \(\mathcal{E}_\delta \cup \{E\}\), i.e., \(\overline{A}\) is a countable intersection of sets in \(\mathcal{E} \cup \{E\}.\) We claim, and show next, that \(A\) is an \(\mathcal{E}\)-envelope of a given decreasing sequence \(\{A_k\}_{k \in \mathbb N} \subseteq \mathfrak{P}(E)\) if, and only if, \(A\) contains \(\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb N} \overline{A}_k.\)</p>

<div class="proof"><p><strong>Closure under countable intersections:</strong></p>

For any \(n \in \mathbb N\) and sets \(P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n\) we define <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} \varphi_n(P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n) = \begin{cases} P_n &\text{if } A \cap P_1 \notin \mathcal{C} \\ f_n(A^p \cap P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n) &\text{if } A \cap P_1 \in \mathcal{C}, \end{cases}\end{aligned}\]</div> where \(p\) is the smallest integer such that \(A^p \cap P_1 \in \mathcal{C}.\) Such an integer does exist from part 2. of the definition of capacitance with the sequence being \(A^k \cap P_1 \uparrow A \cap P_1 \in \mathcal C.\) It is easy to see that \(\Phi = \{\varphi_n\} _ {n \in \mathbb N}\) is a \(\mathcal{C}\)-scraper.

<p>Let \(\{P_n\} _ {n \in \mathbb N}\) be a \(\Phi\)-scraped sequence of sets such that \(P_1 \subseteq A.\) By definition \(P_1 \in \mathcal{C}\) and \(A \cap P_1 = P_1\), and so from our construction \(\varphi_n(P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n) = f_n(A^p \cap P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n).\) All elements of the sequence \(A^p \cap P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n, \ldots\) are in \(\mathcal{C}\) and for all \(n \in \mathbb N\) <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} P_{n+1} \subseteq \varphi_n(P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n) = f_n(A^p \cap P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n),\end{aligned}\]</div> and thus it follows that this sequence is \(\mathfrak{f}\)-scraped.

To see the ascending property, note that increasing sequence \(\{A_n\} _ {n \in \mathbb N} \subseteq \mathfrak{P}(K \times \Omega)\) we have <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} x \in \pi \left( \bigcup_n A_n \right) \iff \exists \; y \in K \text{ such that } (y,x) \in \bigcup_n A_n \iff x \in \bigcup_n \pi(A_n),\end{aligned}\]</div>  showing \(\pi \left( \bigcup_n A_n \right) = \bigcup_n \pi(A_n).\) Thus, <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} I\left( \bigcup_n A_n \right) = \mathbb{P}^*\left( \bigcup_n \pi(A_n) \right) = \sup_n \mathbb{P}^*(\pi(A_n)) = \sup_n I(A_n).\end{aligned}\]</div>  Finally, for the descending on pavings property, compactness implies that for all \(\omega \in \Omega\), \((\mathscr{K} \otimes_p \mathcal{F})(\omega)\) is a compact paving, and thus we can apply Lemma 3 to get <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} \pi\left(\bigcap _ {n \in \mathbb N} E_n\right) = \bigcap _ {n \in \mathbb N} \pi(E_n)\end{aligned}\]</div>  for every decreasing sequence \(\{E_n\} _ {n \in \mathbb N} \subseteq \mathscr{K} \otimes_p \mathcal{F}.\) Therefore, <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} I\left(\bigcap _ {n \in \mathbb N} E_n\right) = \mathbb{P}^* \left(\bigcap _ {n \in \mathbb N} \pi(E_n)\right).\end{aligned}\]</div>  Since \(E_n\) is a finite union of rectangles, \(\pi(E_n) \in \mathcal{F}\) and therefore, <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} \mathbb{P}^* \left(\bigcap _ {n \in \mathbb N} \pi(E_n)\right) = \inf_n \mathbb{P}^* (\pi(E_n)) = \inf_n I(E_n).\end{aligned}\]</div></p>

<p>We are now ready to prove some major results in measure theory.</p>
<h2 id="measurable_projection"><a href="#measurable_projection" class="header-anchor">Measurable Projection</a></h2>
<div class="thm"><strong>Theorem 7 &#91;Measurable Projection&#93;</strong>: Let \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})\) be a complete probability space, let \((K, \mathcal{B}(K))\) be a locally compact separable metric space endowed with the collection of its Borel sets, and denote by \(\pi\) the projection of \(K \times \Omega\) onto \(\Omega.\) Then, for every \(B \in \mathcal{B}(K) \otimes \mathcal{F}\), the projection \(\pi(B) \in \mathcal{F}.\)</div>
<div class="proof"><p>We start by noticing \(\mathcal{B}(K) \widehat{\otimes}_p \mathcal{F} = \mathcal{B}(K) \otimes \mathcal{F}.\) This follows from the fact that if \(A \in \mathcal{B}(K) \otimes_p \mathcal{F}\), then \(A = \bigcup _ {i=1}^n U_i \times V_i\) for some \(U_i \in \mathcal{B}(K)\) and \(V_i \in \mathcal{F}\), and thus it can be shown \(A^\mathsf{c} \in \mathcal{B}(K) \widehat{\otimes}_p \mathcal{F}\), and thus Lemma 1 gives <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} \mathcal{B}(K) \widehat{\otimes}_p \mathcal{F} = \sigma(\mathcal{B}(K) \otimes_p \mathcal{F}) = \mathcal{B}(K) \otimes \mathcal{F}.\end{aligned}\]</div></p>
<p>Consider the paving \(\mathscr{K}\) on \(K\) consisting of all compact subsets of \(K\), and introduce the \((\mathscr{K} \otimes_p \mathcal{F})\)-capacity \(I(A) = \mathbb{P}^*(\pi(A))\), \(A \in \mathcal{B}(K \times \Omega)\) we saw before. Now note <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} \mathcal{B}(K) \widehat{\otimes}_p \mathcal{F} = \mathscr{K} \widehat{\otimes}_p \mathcal{F},\end{aligned}\]</div> the mosaic generated by the paving \(\mathscr{K} \otimes_p \mathcal{F}.\) Showing \(\supseteq\) is trivial; for \(\subseteq\) let \(A \in \mathcal{B}(K) \otimes_p \mathcal{F}\) and show \(A \in \mathscr{K} \widehat{\otimes}_p \mathcal{F}\) by recalling \(\mathcal{B}(K) = \widehat{\mathscr{K}}.\)</p>
<p>Choquet&#39;s capacitability theorem &#40;Theorem 6&#41; thus guarantees that every set in \(\mathcal{B}(K) \otimes \mathcal{F}\) is \(I\)-capacitable. In particular, for every integer \(n \in \mathbb N\), there exists a set \(C_n \in (\mathscr{K} \otimes_p \mathcal{F})_\delta\) contained in \(B\) and such that <a id="eq1" class="anchor"></a>\[\begin{aligned} 
I(C_n) \le I(B) \le I(C_n) + (1/n).\end{aligned}\] Because \(C_n \in (\mathscr{K} \otimes_p \mathcal{F})_\delta\), \(C_n\) is a countable intersection \(C_n = \bigcap _ {m \in \mathbb N} G_n^m\), where each \(G_n^m\) is a finite union of sets of the form \(U \times V\) with \(U \in \mathscr{K}, V \in \mathcal{F}.\) Letting \(H_n^m = \bigcap _ {i=1}^m G_n^i\), we see that \(H_n^1 \supseteq H_n^2 \supseteq \cdots\) and \(C_n = \bigcap _ {m \in \mathbb N} H_n^m\), where now \(H_n^m\) is also a finite union of sets of the form \(U \times V\) with \(U \in \mathscr{K}, V \in \mathcal{F}.\)</p>
<p>The form of \(H_n^m\) immediately implies \(\pi(H_n^m) \in \mathcal{F}\) for all \((m,n) \in \mathbb N^2.\) Lemma 3 implies <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} \pi(C_n) = \pi\left(\bigcap _ {m \in \mathbb N} H_n^m\right) = \bigcap _ {m \in \mathbb N} \pi(H_n^m) \in \mathcal{F}, \quad \forall \; n \in \mathbb N,\end{aligned}\]</div> which further implies <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} \pi\left(\bigcup _ {n \in \mathbb N} C_n\right) = \bigcup _ {n \in \mathbb N} \pi(C_n) \in \mathcal{F}.\end{aligned}\]</div> On the other hand, \(C_n \subseteq B\) for all \({n \in \mathbb N}\) and thus \(\pi\left(\bigcup _ {n \in \mathbb N} C_n\right) \subseteq B.\) But <span class="eqref">(<a href="#eq1">2</a>)</span> implies that the difference of these two sets is a \(\mathbb{P}\)-null set, and the completeness of the probability space gives the desired conclusion \(\pi(B) \in \mathcal{F}.\)</p></div>
<p>It is not easy to construct an example of a Borel set in the product space whose projection is not Borel. It requires study of analytic sets. Check out Corollary 8.2.17 in <span class="bibref"><a href="#cohn">(Cohn, 2013)</a></span> for more details.</p>
<h2 id="measurable_graph"><a href="#measurable_graph" class="header-anchor">Measurable Graph</a></h2>
<p>The next theorem is a very visual theorem, especially for the case where \(K\) and \(\Omega\) are \(\mathbb R.\)</p>
<div class="def"><p><strong>Definition 16</strong>: For a map \(f \colon X \to Y\), we define its <em>graph</em> \(\llbracket f \rrbracket\) to be the product set <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} \llbracket f \rrbracket := \{(y,x) \in Y \times X \,:\, f(x) = y \}.\end{aligned}\]</div></p>
<p>We call a set \(G \in \mathcal{B}(K) \otimes \mathcal{F}\) a <em>measurable graph</em>, if for every \(\omega \in \Omega\) its section \(G(\omega) = \{y \in K\,:\,(y,\omega) \in G\}\) contains at most one point.</p></div>
<div class="thm"><strong>Theorem 8 &#91;Measurable Graph&#93;</strong>: A subset \(G\) of \(K \times \Omega\) is a measurable graph, if and only if, there exists a set \(\Xi \in \mathcal{F}\) and a measurable mapping \(g \colon \Xi \to K\), such that \(G = \llbracket g \rrbracket.\)</div>
<div class="proof"><p><strong>Sufficiency:</strong> If \(\Xi\) and \(g\) are as stated, the set \(G = \{(y,\omega) \in K \times \Xi\,:\,y = g(\omega)\}\) equals the pre-image \(\varphi^{-1}(\Delta)\) of the diagonal \(\Delta = \{(y,y) \in K \times K\,:\,y \in K\}\) under the mapping <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} K \times \Xi \ni (y,\omega) \mapsto \varphi(y,\omega) := (y, g(\omega)) \in K \times K.\end{aligned}\]</div> This mapping \(\varphi\) is \((\mathcal{B}(K) \otimes \mathcal{F})\)-measurable because of the facts that \(\mathcal{B}(K \times K) = \mathcal{B}(K) \otimes \mathcal{B}(K)\), on account of \(K\) being separable, and that \(g\) is measurable. Since \(\Delta\) is a closed set &#40;because \(K\) is Hausdorff&#41;, \(\Delta \in \mathcal{B}(K \times K)\) and thus \(G\) is a measurable graph.</p>
<p><strong>Necessity:</strong> Suppose that \(G\) is a measurable graph, and let \(\Xi := \pi(G).\) Then \(\Xi \in \mathcal{F}\) by the Measurable Projection theorem. For every \(\omega \in \Xi\), define \(g(\omega)\) to be the unique element of the set \(G(\omega).\) We want to show \(g \colon \Xi \to K\) is measurable. Indeed for any \(H \in \mathcal{B}(K)\), it is easy to see that <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} g^{-1}(H) = \pi\left(G \cap (H \times \Omega)\right) \in \mathcal{F},\end{aligned}\]</div> where the inclusion follows from Measurable Projection theorem.</p></div>
<h2 id="debut"><a href="#debut" class="header-anchor">Debut</a></h2>
<p>Now let \(K = [0, \infty)\), the case important in stochastic processes.</p>
<div class="def"><strong>Definition 17</strong>: Let \(A \subseteq [0, \infty) \times \Omega.\) The <em>debut</em> of \(A\) is the nonnegative function \(D_A \colon \Omega \to [0, \infty]\) defined as <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} D_A(\omega) = \inf\{t \in [0, \infty)\,:\,(t, \omega) \in A\}.\end{aligned}\]</div></div>

<div class="proof">For any given real number \(t > 0\), the set \(D_A^{-1}([0,t)) = \{\omega \in \Omega\,:\,D_A(\omega) < t\}\) is the projection onto \(\Omega\) of the measurable subset \(A \cap ([0, t) \times \Omega) \in \mathcal{B}([0, \infty)) \otimes \mathcal{F}.\) To see this, note <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} \omega \in D_A^{-1}([0,t)) \iff 0 \le D_A(\omega) < t \iff \exists \, s \in [0,t) \text{ such that } (s,\omega) \in A \iff \omega \in \pi(A \cap ([0, t) \times \Omega)).\end{aligned}\]</div> Measurable Projection theorem shows that this set is in \(\mathcal{F}.\)</div>
<h2 id="measurable_section"><a href="#measurable_section" class="header-anchor">Measurable Section</a></h2>
<p>Let \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})\) be a complete probability space, and consider a set \(A \subseteq [0, \infty) \times \Omega.\) Then for every \(\omega \in \pi(A),\) there exists a \(t \in [0, \infty)\) such that \((t, \omega) \in A.\) In other words, we can define a mapping \(Z \colon \pi(A) \to [0, \infty).\) It is convenient to extend \(Z\) to the whole of \(\Omega\) by setting \(Z = \infty\) on \(\Omega \setminus \pi(A).\) When is it possible to choose \(Z\) such that it is measurable? The measurable section theorem &#40;also known as measurable selection theorem&#41; says that it is possible to define \(Z\) to be measurable if \(A \in \mathcal{B}([0, \infty)) \otimes \mathcal{F}.\)</p>
<p>Recall that for \(Z \colon \Omega \to [0, \infty]\) its graph is the product set <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} \llbracket Z \rrbracket = \{(t,\omega) \in [0, \infty) \times \Omega \,:\, Z(\omega) = t\}.\end{aligned}\]</div></p>
<p>The condition \((Z(\omega), \omega) \in A\) whenever \(Z < \infty\) can then be expressed by saying \(\llbracket Z \rrbracket \subseteq A.\)</p>
<p>Other than stochastic processes, measurable section theorems have applications in optimal control and game theory.</p>
<div class="thm"><strong>Theorem 10 &#91;Measurable Section&#93;</strong>: Let \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})\) be a complete probability space, and consider a measurable set \(A \in \mathcal{B}([0, \infty)) \otimes \mathcal{F}.\) Then there exists a random variable \(Z \colon \Omega \to [0, \infty]\) with \(\llbracket Z \rrbracket \subseteq A\) and \(\{Z < \infty\} = \pi(A).\)</div>
<div class="proof"><p>We divide our analysis into two parts. <strong>We shall first show that</strong> for every \(\varepsilon > 0\) there exists a random variable \(Z_\varepsilon \colon \Omega \to [0, \infty]\) with \(\llbracket Z_\varepsilon \rrbracket \subseteq A\) and <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} \mathbb{P}(\pi(A)) \le \mathbb{P}(Z_\varepsilon < \infty) + \varepsilon.\end{aligned}\]</div> To this end, recall that if \(K = [0, \infty)\) and \(\mathscr{K}\) is the paving of all compact subsets of \(K\), then we have the \(\mathscr{K} \otimes_p \mathcal{F}\)-capacity \(I(A) = \mathbb{P}^*(\pi(A)), A \in \mathfrak{P}(K \times \Omega).\) Therefore, every \(A \in \mathcal{B}(K) \otimes \mathcal{F}\) is \(I\)-capacitable, and fixing \(A\), for every \(\varepsilon > 0,\) there exists a set <div class="nonumber"><a id="eq2" class="anchor"></a>\[\begin{aligned} 
C_\varepsilon \in (\mathscr{K} \otimes_p \mathcal{F})_\delta \text{ such that } C_\varepsilon \subseteq A, \quad I(C_\varepsilon) \le I(A) \le I(C_\varepsilon) + \varepsilon.\end{aligned}\]</div> Let <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} Z_\varepsilon := D_{C_\varepsilon}\end{aligned}\]</div> be the debut of this set \(C_\varepsilon.\) Then the Measurable Debut theorem &#40;Theorem 9&#41; implies \(Z_\varepsilon\) is a random variable.</p>
<p>For every \(\omega \in \Omega\), the section \(C_\varepsilon(\omega)\) is a compact subset of \(K\) &#40;use the facts that compact \(\iff\) closed and bounded here, and \(C_\varepsilon \in (\mathscr{K} \otimes_p \mathcal{F})_\delta\)&#41;. Notice that if \((t, \omega) \in \llbracket D_{C_\varepsilon} \rrbracket\) then \(D_{C_\varepsilon}(\omega) = t\) which is same as saying \(t = \inf \{s \in [0, \infty)\,:\,(s,\omega) \in C_\varepsilon\}\), but since \(C_\varepsilon(\omega)\) is closed this implies \((t, \omega) \in C_\varepsilon.\) Therefore, \(\llbracket Z_\varepsilon \rrbracket \subseteq C_\varepsilon\), showing the first requirement.</p>
<p>The second requirement \(\mathbb{P}\left(\pi(A)\right) \le \mathbb{P}\left(Z_\varepsilon < \infty\right) + \varepsilon\) is true because \(\pi(A) \in \mathcal{F}\) by the Measurable Projection theorem &#40;Theorem 7&#41; and \(\{Z_\varepsilon < \infty\} = \pi(C_\varepsilon) \in \mathcal{F}\), and now use <span class="eqref">(<a href="#eq2">2</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Let us now construct a random variable \(Z\) to satisfy the properties claimed in the theorem.</strong> Define <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} A_1 := A.\end{aligned}\]</div> Then from above there exists a random variable <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} Z_1 \colon \Omega \to [0, \infty] \text{ with } \llbracket Z_1 \rrbracket \subseteq A_1 \text{ and } \mathbb{P}(Z_1 < \infty) \ge \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{P}(\pi(A_1)),\end{aligned}\]</div> by taking \(\varepsilon = \mathbb{P}\left(Z_1 < \infty\right) > 0\); if it happens that \(\mathbb{P}\left(Z_1 < \infty\right) = 0\), then \(\mathbb{P}\left(\pi(A_1)\right) = 0\) and the inequality is still true. Now define <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} A_2 := A_1 \setminus \left([0, \infty) \times \{Z_1 < \infty\}\right),\end{aligned}\]</div> and, reasoning as before, construct a random variable <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} Z_2 \colon \Omega \to [0, \infty] \text{ with } \llbracket Z_2 \rrbracket \subseteq A_2 \text{ and } \mathbb{P}(Z_2 < \infty) &\ge \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{P}(\pi(A_2)) \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \left( \mathbb{P}(\pi(A_1)) - \mathbb{P}(Z_1 < \infty) \right).\end{aligned}\]</div> Continuing this way, we obtain a sequence \(\{Z_n\} _ {n \in \mathbb N}\) such that \(\llbracket Z_n \rrbracket \subseteq A\), the projections \(\pi(\llbracket Z_n \rrbracket)\) are disjoint, and we have <a id="eq3" class="anchor"></a>\[\begin{aligned} 
\sum_{k=1}^n \mathbb{P}(Z_k < \infty) \ge \left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{2^n} \right) \mathbb{P}(\pi(A_1)) = (1 - 2^{-n})\mathbb{P}(\pi(A)), \quad \forall n \in \mathbb N.\end{aligned}\] Therefore, the random variable \(Z\) defined as <div class="nonumber">\[\begin{aligned} Z(\omega) = \begin{cases}
Z_k(\omega) &\text{if } \omega \in \{Z_k < \infty\} \text{ for some } k \in \mathbb N \\
\infty &\text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}\end{aligned}\]</div> satisfies \(\llbracket Z \rrbracket \subseteq A\), thus also \(\{Z < \infty\} \subseteq \pi(A).\)</p>
<p>On the other hand, letting \(n \to \infty\) in <span class="eqref">(<a href="#eq3">3</a>)</span>, we see that \(\{Z < \infty\}\) and \(\pi(A)\) have the same probability. Therefore, the completeness of the probability space implies these two sets can be made equal.</p></div>
