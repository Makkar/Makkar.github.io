<div style="text-align: justify"> 
<p>I have been attending a reading course on stochastic analysis led by 
<a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~ik/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Professor Ioannis Karatzas</a>, where the students take turn in presenting a topic of their choice. I recently presented on Choquet&rsquo;s theory of capacities and its applications to measure theory and in the general theory of processes. This blog post is based on this presentation. I have freely copied<sup>
<a href="#plagiarism">1</a></sup> from many sources, but my primary reference are the unfortunately unpublished lecture notes by Prof. Karatzas.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Kolmogorov laid the modern axiomatic foundations of probability theory with the German monograph <em>Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung</em> which appeared in Ergebnisse Der Mathematik in 1933. This was a period of intense discussions on the foundations of probability, and a majority of probabilists at the time considered measure theory not only a waste of time, but also an offense to &ldquo;probabilistic intuition&rdquo; [1]. But by 1950, with the work of Doob in particular, these discussions of foundations had been settled.</p>
<p>Continuous-time processes, on the other hand, was difficult to tame even with measure theory: if a particle is subject to random evolution, to show that its trajectory is continuous, or bounded, requires that all time values be considered, whereas classical measure theory can only handle a <em>countable</em> infinity of time values. Thus, not only does probability depend on measure theory, but it also requires more of measure theory than the rest of analysis [1].</p>
<p>The missing pieces of the puzzle, which will be the highlight of this and the next blog post, are the debut, section and projection theorems. These theorems are also indispensable in many applications, for instance in dynamic programming and stochastic control [3].</p>
<p>To get a taste of these theorems, let&rsquo;s recall a famous error made by Lebesgue in the paper <em>Sur les fonctions représentables analytiquement</em> published in 1905. Consider the measurable space $(\R^2, \B(\R^2))$ and the projection map $\pi$ given by $\R^2 \ni (x,y) \mapsto \pi(x,y) = y \in \R$. It is easy to see that for any open set $O$ in $\R^2$, the set $\pi(O)$ is also open in $\R$ : Recall that the standard topology on $\R^2$ is same as the product topology on $\R^2$. By definition of the product topology on $\R^2$ an open set $O$ in $\R^2$ is  of the form $O = \bigcup_{i \in I} \bigcap_{j \in J_i} U_{ij} \times V_{ij}$ for open $U_{ij}, V_{ij}$ in $\R$, $I$ arbitrary and $J_i$ finite. A simple argument gives $\pi_2(O) = \bigcup_{i \in I} \bigcap_{j \in J_i} U_{ij}$ which is open in $\R$. In fact, more generally 
<a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Projection_from_Product_Topology_is_Open" target="_blank" rel="noopener">projection from product topology is open</a>. Now it seems reasonable to expect that for any Borel set $B \in \B(\R^2)$ its projection is also a Borel set in $\B(\R)$, and Lebesgue assumed this in his paper. But, in fact, this is FALSE! The error was spotted in around 1917 by Mikhail Suslin, who realised that the projection need not be Borel, and this lead to his investigation of analytic sets and to begin the study of what is now known as descriptive set theory [2].</p>
<p>The problem is projection doesn&rsquo;t commute with countable decreasing intersection. For example, consider the decreasing sequence of sets $S_n = (0, 1/n) \times \R$. Then $\pi(S_n) = \R$ for all $n$, giving $\bigcap_\nn \pi(S_n) = \R$, but $\bigcap_\nn S_n = \emp$, giving $\pi \left( \bigcap_\nn S_n \right) = \emp$. The measurable projection theorem stated next will be one of the highlights of this post.</p>
<p><span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Measurable Projection Theorem: </span> Let $\probsp$ be a complete probability space, let $(K, \B(K))$ be a locally compact separable metric space endowed with the collection of its Borel sets, and denote by $\pi$ the projection of $K \times \Omega$ onto $\Omega$.
Then, for every $B \in \B(K) \otimes \F$, the projection $\pi(B) \in \F$.</p>
<p>Why is proving such results difficult? As mentioned above it&rsquo;s because projection doesn&rsquo;t behave nicely with intersections. Nevertheless, let us try to see how one might try to prove the above theorem. A standard approach in measure theory is to construct a collection like</p>
<p>$$
\mathscr{E} = \set{S \subseteq K \times \Omega}{\pi(S) \in \F}
$$</p>
<p>which contains the sets satisfying the desired property, and show that it is a $\sigma-$algebra containing a simple collection, say $\mathscr{A},$ such that it easy to show that elements of $\mathscr{A}$ satisfy the desired property and $\mathscr{A}$ generates $\B(K) \otimes \F$, because then we will have $\B(K) \otimes \F \subseteq \mathscr{E}$. To this end, let</p>
<p>$$
\mathscr{A} = \set{S \subseteq K \times \Omega}{S = E \times F \text{ for } E \in \B(K), F \in \F}
$$</p>
<p>Then it is easy to see that $\mathscr{A} \subseteq \mathscr{E}$, $\mathscr{A}$ generates $\B(K) \otimes \F$ and that $\mathscr{A}$ is an algebra. If we could show that $\mathscr{E}$ is a monotone class, then we would be done on account of monotone class theorem. Increasing sequences are easily handled, in fact if $\se{S_n} _ \nn \subseteq K \times \Omega$ is any sequence, then</p>
<p>$$
\pi\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty S_n\right) = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \pi(S_n)
$$</p>
<p>But if $S_1 \supseteq S_2 \supseteq \cdots$, then in general we CANNOT say</p>
<p>$$
\pi\left(\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty S_n\right) = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty \pi(S_n)
$$</p>
<p>Enter Choquet&rsquo;s theory of capacities. It provides the language to prove results like these. We know that every finite measure $\mu$ on $\R^d$ has the interior regularity property</p>
<p>$$
\mu(B) = \sup_{\substack{K \in \K(\R^d) \\ K \subseteq B}} \mu(K), \quad \forall \; B \in \B(\R^d)
$$</p>
<p>where $\K(\R^d)$ is the collection of compact sets in $\R^d$. The Choquet&rsquo;s theory of capacities generalizes this approximation-from-below property, and distills those properties of measure that allow for such approximation to hold in very general settings. As we will see, monotonicity and continuity from above and below properties are at play here, and notions corresponding to complements or differences will be absent.</p>
<p>The next few sections will be very abstract and it is easy to lose sight of our goal. Some people enjoy this mental gymnastics, but even if you find this dry, the reward at the end will be worth the initial struggle. We start with Choquet&rsquo;s theory of capacities. The highlight of this part will be Choquet&rsquo;s capacitability theorem. To prove this major result we will need to define a lot of new terminology and prove some major results like Sierpiński&rsquo;s theorem and Sion&rsquo;s theorem. Armed with Choquet&rsquo;s capacitability theorem we will prove Measurable Section theorem which in turn will form the backbone of various other results in measure theory. These results in measure theory will then help us prove results in general theory of processes, but this part we will discuss in the next blog post.</p>
<h1 id="pavings-and-mosaics">Pavings and Mosaics</h1>
<p><span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Definition 1: </span> Let $E$ be a nonempty set. A collection $\E$ of subsets of $E$ is called a <em>paving</em> if it closed under finite unions and finite intersections. The pair $(E, \E)$ is then called a <em>paved space</em>.</p>
<p>The concept of paving generalizes the concept of algebra.
It is easy to check that an arbitrary intersection of pavings is also a paving, and that the collection $\PO(E)$ of all subsets of $E$ is a paving. Thus for any collection $\A$ of subsets of $E$, we can define the notion of <em>paving generated by $\A$</em> as the smallest paving of subsets of $E$ that contains $\A$ by simply defining it to be the intersection of all pavings of $E$ containing $\A$.</p>
<p><span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Definition 2: </span> For two paved spaces $(E,\E)$ and $(F,\F)$, the <em>product paving</em> of $\E$ and $\F$, denoted by $\E \otimes_p \F$, is a paving on $E \times F$ generated by all rectangles $\cR = \set{A \times B}{A \in \E, B \in \F}$.</p>
<p>Using the fact that $(A_1 \times B_1) \cap (A_2 \times B_2) = (A_1 \cap A_2) \times (B_1 \cap B_2)$ we see that $\cR$ is stable under finite intersections. Therefore, any element of $\E \otimes_p \F$ is of the form $\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \times B_i$, where $A_i \in \E$ and $B_i \in \F$ for all $i=1,\ldots,n$.</p>
<p><span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Definition 3: </span> Let $E$ be a nonempty set. A collection of subsets of $E$ which is closed under countable unions and countable intersections is called a <em>mosaic</em>.</p>
<p>The concept of mosaic generalizes the concept of $\sigma-$algebra. Just like paving, it is easy to define the notion of <em>mosaic generated by a collection</em>. They will always occur in the context of a paving $\E$ on $E$. We denote by $\widehat{\E}$ the mosaic generated by $\E$. $\E \PM \F$ will denote the mosaic generated by the product paving $\E \otimes_p \F$.</p>

<h2 id="properties-of-pavings-and-mosaics">Properties of pavings and mosaics</h2>
<p>Just like the results connecting algebra and $\sigma-$algebra, we have results connecting pavings and mosaics.</p>
<p><span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Lemma 1: </span> If $A \in \E$ implies $A^\comp = E \setminus A \in \widehat{\E}$, then $\widehat{\E} = \sigma(\E)$.<br>
<span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Proof: </span> Follows immediately from the monotone class theorem. $\square$</p>
<p>As an example, if $E$ is a separable, locally compact metric space, and $\E = \K(E)$ is the collection of compact subsets of $E$, then this property holds. Too see this, note that in metric spaces compact sets are closed and thus their complement is open. It is a standard result in topology that in this case every open set is a countable union of compact sets. In fact, every second-countable locally compact Hausdorff space is $\sigma-$compact.</p>
<p><span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Lemma 2: </span> The mosaic $\widehat{\E}$ is the smallest collection of subsets of $E$ that contains $\E$ and is closed under countable increasing unions and under countable decreasing intersections. In other words, if $\M(\E)$ denotes the monotone class generated by $\E$, then $\widehat{\E} = \M(\E)$.<br>
<span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Proof: </span> Since a mosaic is a monotone class and since $\E \subseteq \widehat{\E}$, we have $\M(\E) \subseteq \widehat{\E}$. For the other side, we will be done if we show that $\M(\E)$ is a mosaic, since $\E \subseteq \M(\E)$.<br>
The first property to note is that a monotone paving is a mosaic. To see this, let $\cR$ be a monotone paving and $A_1, A_2, \ldots \in \cR$. Then since $\cR$ is a paving, $B_n = \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \in \cR$ for all $\nn$. But $\se{B_n}_\nn$ is an increasing sequence and $\cR$ is a monotone class, and therefore their union $\bigcup_\nn A_n = \bigcup_\nn B_n \in \cR$, and hence $\cR$ is closed under countable unions. Similarly for countable intersections.<br>
Therefore, we will be done if we show that $\M(\E)$ is a paving.
To this end, for any $B \subseteq E$, let
$$\cK(B) := \set{A \subseteq E}{ A \cup B, A \cap B \in \M(\E)}$$
Notice that by symmetry, $A \in \cK(B) \iff B \in \cK(A)$. If $A_1 \subseteq A_2 \subseteq \cdots \in \cK(B)$ is an increasing sequence, then
$$
\bigcup_\nn A_n \cup B = \bigcup_\nn (A_n \cup B) \in \M(\E)
$$
$$
\bigcup_\nn A_n \cap B = \bigcup_\nn (A_n \cap B) \in \M(\E)
$$
and similarly for decreasing sequences. Therefore, if $\cK(B) \neq \emp$, then it is a monotone class. If $A, B \in \E$, then by the definition of paving, $A \in \cK(B)$. Since this is true for every $A \in \E$, we have $\E \subseteq \cK(B)$, and $\cK(B)$ is a monotone class containing $\E$. Since $\M(\E)$ is the smallest monotone class containing $\E$, we have
$$\M(\E) \subseteq \cK(B)$$
Hence if $A \in \M(\E)$ and $B \in \E$, then $A \in \cK(B)$, and therefore $B \in \cK(A)$. Since this is true for every $B \in \E$, it follows that
$$\M(\E) \subseteq \cK(A)$$
The validity of this relation for every $A \in \M(\E)$ is equivalent to the assertion that $\M(\E)$ is a paving. $\square$</p>
<h2 id="compact-pavings">Compact pavings</h2>
<p><span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Definition 4: </span> A paving $\E$ is a <em>compact paving</em>, if every decreasing sequence of nonempty elements of $\E$ has a nonempty intersection.</p>
<p>For example, if $E$ is a separable metric space, the collection, $\K(E)$, of all compact subsets of $E$ is a compact paving. This is easy to see in light of the fact that every compact subset of $E$ is closed and this allows use of Cantor&rsquo;s intersection theorem.
We define $$\E_\delta := \set{\bigcap_{\nn} A_n}{A_n \in \E \text{ for all } n \in \N}$$ and note that if $\E$ is a compact paving then so is $\E_\delta$.

Then, for every decreasing sequence $\se{H_n} _ {n \in \N}$ of sets in the paving $\cH_\delta$, we have
$$\pi\left(\bigcap _ {n \in \N} H_n\right) = \bigcap _ {n \in \N} \pi(H_n)$$
<span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Proof: </span> $\pi\left(\bigcap_{n \in \N} H_n\right) \subseteq \bigcap_{n \in \N} \pi(H_n)$ is easy to see because if $x \in \pi\left(\bigcap_{n \in \N} H_n\right)$ then there exists $(y,x) \in K \times E$ such that $(y,x) \in \bigcap_{n \in \N} H_n$ which implies $x \in \pi(H_n)$ for all $n \in \N$.<br>
For the other side, let $x \in \bigcap_{n \in \N} \pi(H_n)$. Then the sequence $\se{H_n(x)}_{n \in \N}$ is decreasing whose elements are nonempty and they are in $\cH(x)_\delta$. But since $\cH(x)_\delta$ is a compact paving by assumption, $\bigcap_n H_n(x)$ must be nonempty, implying $x \in \pi\left(\bigcap_{n \in \N} H_n\right)$. $\square$</p>

<p>An abstract version of the one above: Let $(E, \E)$ be a paved space; for every subset $A$ of $E$, introduce the collection of sets $\A := \set{B \in \E \cup \se{E}}{A \subseteq B}$ and assume that the intersection $\overline{A} := \bigcap_{B \in \A} B$, called the <i>adherent of $A$ in the paving $\E$</i>, belongs to $\E_\delta \cup \se{E}$, i.e., $\overline{A}$ is a countable intersection of sets in $\E \cup \se{E}$. We claim that $A$ is an $\E-$envelope of a given decreasing sequence $\se{A_k}_{k \in \N} \subseteq \PO(E)$ if, and only if, $A$ contains $\bigcap_{k \in \N} \overline{A}_k$.</p>

To see the sufficiency, for every $k \in \N$, let $\se{B_n^k}_{n \in \N} \subseteq \E \cup \se{E}$ be a decreasing sequence such that $\overline{A}_k = \bigcap_{n \in \N} B_n^k$ (such a sequence exists because of the assumption in Example 2).

<h2 id="mixing-of-scrapers">Mixing of Scrapers</h2>
<p>Consider a sequence $\se{\f^k, k \in \N} = \se{\se{f^k_n} _ \nn, k \in \N}$ of scrapers, and a bijection $\N^2 \ni (p,q) \mapsto \beta(p,q) = p \star q \in \N$ which is strictly increasing in each of its arguments. For every integer $\nn$ and sets $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n$, if $n = p \star q$, let
$$
f_n(P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n) := f^p_q(P_{p \star 1}, P_{p \star 2}, \ldots, P_{p \star q})

It is easy to see that this defines a new scraper $\f = \se{f_n}_\nn$, called the <i>mixing of the scrapers $\se{\f^k, k \in \N}$ via the bijection $\beta$</i>.</p>
<p><span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Theorem 5 :</span> Let $\se{\f^k, k \in \N}$ be a sequence of scrapers, and denote by $\f$ its mixing by a bijection $\beta$.

To do this, we exploit Lemma 5 (ii) and construct a decreasing sequence $\se{Q_n} _ \nn \subseteq \PO(E)$ which is subsequence of $\se{P_n} _ \nn$ and show that $A$ envelops $\se{Q_n} _ \nn$. This will then imply $A$ envelops $\se{P_n} _ \nn$. To this end, let $$Q_n := P_{k \star n} \quad \forall \; \nn$$ Because $Q_1 = P_{k \star 1} \subseteq P_{1 \star 1} = P_1 \subseteq A$ and $A$ is compatible with $\f^k$, to show that $A$ envelops $\se{Q_n}_\nn$ it suffices to show $\se{Q_n} _ \nn$ is $\f^k-$scraped.<br>
Now, $Q_n \in \C$ for all $\nn$, so all that remains to be shown is that $Q_{n+1} \subseteq f^k_n(Q_1, Q_2, \ldots, Q_n)$ holds for all $\nn$. Because $\se{P_n} _ \nn$ is $\f-$scraped we have $$Q_{n+1} = P_{k \star (n+1)} \subseteq P_{1 + k\star n} \subseteq f_{k \star n}(P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_{k \star n}) = f^k_n(Q_1, Q_2, \ldots, Q_n)$$ giving the desired result. $\square$</p>

\varphi_n(P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n) = \begin{cases} P_n &amp;\text{if } A \cap P_1 \notin \C \\ f_n(A^p \cap P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n) &amp;\text{if } A \cap P_1 \in \C \end{cases}
$$
where $p$ is the smallest integer such that $A^p \cap P_1 \in \C$. Such an integer does exist from part (ii) of the definition of capacitance. It is easy to see that $\Phi = \se{\varphi_n} _ \nn$ is a $\C-$scraper. It is sufficient to show that $\Phi$ is compatible with $A$ to finish our proof.<br>
Let $\se{P_n} _ \nn$ be a $\Phi-$scraped sequence of sets such that $P_1 \subseteq A$. By definition $P_1 \in \C$ and $A \cap P_1 = P_1$, and so from our construction $\varphi_n(P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n) = f_n(A^p \cap P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n)$. All elements of the sequence $A^p \cap P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n, \ldots$ are in $\C$ and for all $n \in \N$
$$
P_{n+1} \subseteq \varphi_n(P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n) = f_n(A^p \cap P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n)
$$
and thus it follows that this sequence is $\f-$scraped. Now since $A^p$ is compatible with $\f$, $A^p$ is an envelope of this sequence, and also of $\se{P_n} _ \nn$ by Lemma 5 (ii). It follows that $A$ is an envelope of $\se{P_n} _ \nn$ by Lemma 5 (i) because $A^p \subseteq A$. $\square$</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Consider a paved space $(E, \E)$ with compact paving $\E$, and define $I(A) = 0$ if $A = \emp$, $I(A) = 1$ if $A \neq \emp$. Then $I$ is a Choquet $\E-$capacity. The property (iii) in the definition of capacity reflects now the assumption that the paving $\E$ is compact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider a probability space $\probsp$, then the outer measure
$$\PP^*(A) := \inf_{\substack{B \in \F \ A \subseteq B}} \PP(B)$$
is a Choquet $\F-$capacity. Proof of this is a standard exercise in measure theory, albeit with a different terminology of continuity from below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider a locally compact, separable metric space $K$, and the paving $\K$ of its compact subsets. If $\pi$ denotes the projection of $K \times \Omega$ onto $\Omega$ and $$I(A) := \PP^*(\pi(A)) \text{ for all } A \in \PO(K \times \Omega),$$ then $I$ is a Choquet $(\K \otimes_p \F)-$capacity. Proof of this follows from $\pi\left( \bigcup_n A_n\right) = \bigcup_n \pi(A_n)$ and Lemma 3 combined with the properties of outer measure.</p>

</ol>
<p><span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Theorem 6 [Choquet&rsquo;s capacitability theorem]:</span> Consider a paved space $(E, \E)$, and let $I \colon \PO(E) \to \RR$ be a Choquet $\E-$capacity. Then every set $A \in \widehat{\E}$ is $I-$capacitable.<br>
<span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Proof:</span> Fix an arbitrary set $A \in \widehat{\E}$. If $I(A) = -\infty$ then $I(A) = I(\emp)$, and we have our desired equality trivially. Otherwise, we need to show that whenever $I(A) &gt; t$ holds for some given real number $t$, there exists a set $K \in \E_\delta$ with $K \subseteq A$ and $I(K) \ge t$.<br>
Recall that $$\C = \set{B \in \PO(E)}{I(B) &gt; t}$$ is a capacitance. Then $A \in \C$, and from Sion&rsquo;s Theorem (Theorem 4) there exists a decreasing sequence $\se{K_n} _ \nn$ of elements in $\E \cap \C$ such that $\bigcap _ \nn K_n \subseteq A$. But then $I\left(\bigcap _ \nn K_n\right) = \inf _ \nn I(K_n) \ge t$, and thus we can take $K = \bigcap_\nn K_n$. $\square$</p>
<p>We are now ready to prove some major results in measure theory.</p>
<h1 id="measurable-projection">Measurable Projection</h1>
<p><span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Theorem 7 [Measurable Projection]:</span> Let $\probsp$ be a complete probability space, let $(K, \B(K))$ be a locally compact separable metric space endowed with the collection of its Borel sets, and denote by $\pi$ the projection of $K \times \Omega$ onto $\Omega$. Then, for every $B \in \B(K) \otimes \F$, the projection $\pi(B) \in \F$.</p>
<p><span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Proof:</span> We start by noticing $\B(K) \PM \F = \B(K) \otimes \F$. This follows from the fact that if $A \in \B(K) \otimes_p \F$, then $A = \bigcup _ {i=1}^n U_i \times V_i$ for some $U_i \in \B(K)$ and $V_i \in \F$, and thus it can be shown $A^\comp \in \B(K) \PM \F$, and thus Lemma 1 gives $\B(K) \PM \F = \sigma(\B(K) \otimes_p \F) = \B(K) \otimes \F$.</p>
<p>Consider the paving $\K$ on $K$ consisting of all compact subsets of $K$, and introduce the $(\K \otimes_p \F)-$capacity $I(A) = \PP^*(\pi(A))$, $A \in \B(K \times \Omega)$. Recall that $\B(K) = \widehat{\K}$, and so $\B(K) \PM \F = \K \PM \F$, the mosaic generated by the paving $\K \otimes_p \F$ ($\supseteq$ is trivial. For $\subseteq$ let $A \in \B(K) \otimes_p \F$ and show $A \in \K \PM \F$).</p>
<p>Choquet&rsquo;s capacitability theorem (Theorem 6) thus guarantees that every set in $\B(K) \otimes \F$ is $I-$capacitable. In particular, for every integer $n \in \N$, there exists a set $C_n \in (\K \otimes_p \F)_\delta$ contained in $B$ and such that</p>
<p>$$I(C_n) \le I(B) \le I(C_n) + (1/n) \tag{2} \label{ms}$$</p>
<p>Because $C_n \in (\K \otimes_p \F)_\delta$, $C_n$ is a countable intersection $C_n = \bigcap _ {m \in \N} G_n^m$, where each $G_n^m$ is a finite union of sets of the form $U \times V (U \in \K, V \in \F)$. Letting $H_n^m = \bigcap _ {i=1}^m G_n^i$, we see that $H_n^1 \supseteq H_n^2 \supseteq \cdots$ and $C_n = \bigcap _ {m \in \N} H_n^m$, where now $H_n^m$ is also a finite union of sets of the form $U \times V (U \in \K, V \in \F)$.</p>
<p>The form of $H_n^m$ immediately implies $\pi(H_n^m) \in \F$ for all $(m,n) \in \N^2$. Lemma 3  implies
$$\pi(C_n) = \pi\left(\bigcap _ {m \in \N} H_n^m\right) = \bigcap _ {m \in \N} \pi(H_n^m) \in \F, \quad \forall \; n \in \N$$
which further implies $\pi\left(\bigcup _ {n \in \N} C_n\right) = \bigcup _ {n \in \N} \pi(C_n) \in \F$.</p>
<p>On the other hand, $C_n \subseteq B$ for all $\nn$ and thus $\pi\left(\bigcup _ {n \in \N} C_n\right) \subseteq B$. But \eqref{ms} implies that the difference of these two sets is a $\PP-$null set, and the completeness of the probability space gives the desired conclusion $\pi(B) \in \F$. $\square$</p>
<h1 id="measurable-graph">Measurable Graph</h1>
<p><span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Definition 15:</span> We call a set $G \in \B(K) \otimes \F$ <i>measurable graph</i>, if for every $\omega \in \Omega$ the section $G(\omega) = \set{y \in K}{(y,\omega) \in G}$ contains at most one point.</p>
<p><span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Theorem 8 [Measurable Graph]:</span> A subset $G$ of $K \times \Omega$ is a measurable graph, if and only if, there exists a set $\Xi \in \F$ and a measurable mapping $g \colon \Xi \to K$, such that $G = \set{(y,\omega) \in K \times \Xi}{y = g(\omega)}$.<br>
<span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Proof: Sufficiency.</span> If $\Xi$ and $g$ are as stated, the set $G = \set{(y,\omega) \in K \times \Xi}{y = g(\omega)}$ equals the pre-image $\varphi^{-1}(\Delta)$ of the diagonal $\Delta = \set{(y,y) \in K \times K}{y \in K}$ under the mapping
$$K \times \Xi \ni (y,\omega) \mapsto \varphi(y,\omega) := (y, g(\omega)) \in K \times K$$
This mapping $\varphi$ is $(\B(K) \otimes \F)-$measurable because of the fact that $\B(K \times K) = \B(K) \otimes \B(K)$ and that $g$ is measurable. Since $\Delta$ is a closed set, $\Delta \in \B(K \times K)$ and thus $G$ is a measurable graph.<br>
<span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Necessity.</span> Suppose that $G$ is a measurable graph, and let $\Xi := \pi(G)$. Then $\Xi \in \F$ by Measurable Projection theorem. For every $\omega \in \Xi$, define $g(\omega)$ to be the unique element of the set $G(\omega)$. We want to show $g \colon \Xi \to K$ is measurable. Indeed for any $H \in \B(K)$, it is easy to see that $g^{-1}(H) = \pi\left(G \cap (H \times \Omega)\right) \in \F$ where the inclusion follows from Measurable Projection theorem. $\square$</p>

<p><span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Definition 16:</span> Let $A \subseteq [0, \infty) \times \Omega$. The <em>debut</em> of $A$ is the nonnegative function $D_A \colon \Omega \to \RR$ defined as

<p><span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Theorem 9 [Measurable Debut]:</span> Let $\probsp$ be a complete probability space, and consider a measurable set $A \in \B([0, \infty)) \otimes \F.$ Then the debut $D_A$ of this set is a random variable.<br>

To see this, note $\omega \in D_A^{-1}([0,t))$ $\iff$ $0 \le D_A(\omega) &lt; t$ $\iff$ $\exists , s \in [0,t)$ such that $(s, \omega) \in A$ $\iff$ $\omega \in \pi(A \cap ([0, t) \times \Omega))$.  Measurable Projection theorem shows that this set is in $\F$. $\square$</p>
<h1 id="measurable-section">Measurable Section</h1>
<p>Let $\probsp$ be a complete probability space, and consider a set $A \subseteq \oi \times \Omega$. Then for every $\omega \in \pi(A)$, there exists a $t \in \oi$ such that $(t, \omega) \in A$. In other words, we can define a mapping $Z \colon \pi(A) \to \oi$. It is convenient to extend $Z$ to the whole of $\Omega$ by setting $Z = \infty$ on $\Omega \setminus \pi(A)$. When is $Z$ measurable? The measurable section theorem (also known as measurable selection theorem) says that it is possible to define $Z$ to be measurable if $A \in \B(\oi) \otimes \F$.</p>
<p><span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Definition 17:</span> For a mapping $Z \colon \Omega \to [0, \infty]$ we shall define its <em>graph</em> as the product set
$$\gr{Z} := \set{(t, \omega) \in [0, \infty) \times \Omega}{Z(\omega) = t}$$</p>
<p>The condition $(Z(\omega), \omega) \in A$ whenever $Z &lt; \infty$ can then be expressed by saying $\gr{Z} \subseteq A$.</p>
<p><span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Theorem 9 [Measurable Section]:</span> Let $\probsp$ be a complete probability space, and consider a measurable set $A \in \B([0, \infty)) \otimes \F$. Then there exists a random variable $Z \colon \Omega \to [0, \infty]$ with $\gr{Z} \subseteq A$ and $\se{Z &lt; \infty} = \pi(A)$.</p>
<p><span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 16pt">Proof:</span> <span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 14pt">We shall show first, that for every $\eps &gt; 0$ there exists a random variable $Z_\eps \colon \Omega \to [0, \infty]$ with $\gr{Z_\eps} \subseteq A$ and $\Prob{\pi(A)} \le \Prob{Z_\eps &lt; \infty} + \eps$.</span></p>
<p>To this end, recall that if $K = [0, \infty)$ and $\K$ is the paving of all compact subsets of $K$, then we have the $\K \otimes_p \F-$capacity $I(A) = \PP^*(\pi(A)), A \in \PO(K \times \Omega)$. Therefore, every $A \in \B(K) \otimes \F$ is $I-$capacitable, and fixing $A$, there exists for every $\eps &gt; 0$ a set $C_\eps \in (\K \otimes_p \F)_\delta$ such that
$$C_\eps \subseteq A, \quad I(C_\eps) \le I(A) \le I(C_\eps) + \eps \tag{3} \label{eq_sec}$$
Let $Z_\eps := D_{C_\eps}$ be the debut of this $C_\eps$, then Measurable Debut theorem (Theorem 9) implies $Z_\eps$ is a random variable. For every $\omega \in \Omega$, the section $C_\eps(\omega)$ is a compact subset of $K$ (use the facts that compact$\iff$closed and bounded here, and $C_\eps \in (\K \otimes_p \F)_\delta$). Notice that if $(t, \omega) \in \gr{D_{C_\eps}}$ then $D_{C_\eps}(\omega) = t$ which is same as saying $t = \inf \set{s \in [0, \infty)}{(s,\omega) \in C_\eps}$, but since $C_\eps(\omega)$ is closed this implies $(t, \omega) \in C_\eps$. Therefore, $\gr{Z_\eps} \subseteq C_\eps$, showing the first requirement.</p>
<p>The second requirement $\Prob{\pi(A)} \le \Prob{Z_\eps &lt; \infty} + \eps$ is true because $\pi(A) \in \F$ by Measurable Projection theorem (Theorem 7) and $\se{Z_\eps &lt; \infty} = \pi(C_\eps) \in \F$, and now use \eqref{eq_sec}.</p>
<p><span style="color:darkgray; font-size: 14pt">Let us now construct a random variable $Z$ to satisfy the properties claimed in the theorem.</span> Set $A_1 = A$; from above there exists a random variable $Z_1 \colon \Omega \to [0, \infty]$ with $\gr{Z_1} \subseteq A_1$ and $\Prob{\pi(A_1)} \le 2 \Prob{Z_1 &lt; \infty}$, by taking $\eps = \Prob{Z_1 &lt; \infty} &gt; 0$; if it happens that $\Prob{Z_1 &lt; \infty} = 0$, then $\Prob{\pi(A_1)} = 0$ and the inequality is still true.<br>
Set $A_2 = A_1 \setminus ([0, \infty) \times \se{Z_1 &lt; \infty})$ and, reasoning as before, construct $Z_2 \colon \Omega \to [0, \infty]$ with $\gr{Z_2} \subseteq A_2$ and $\Prob{\pi(A_2)} \le 2 \Prob{Z_2 &lt; \infty}$.</p>
<p>Continuing this way, we obtain a sequence $\se{Z_n} _ {\nn}$ such that $\gr{Z_n} \subseteq A$, the projections $\pi(\gr{Z_n})$ are disjoint, and we have
$$\sum_{k=1}^n \Prob{Z_k &lt; \infty} \ge (1 - 2^{-n}) \Prob{\pi(A)}, \quad \forall \; \nn \tag{4} \label{eq_notsure}$$
The random variable $Z$ defined as $Z := Z_k$ on $\se{Z_k &lt; \infty}$ for each $k \in \N$, and $Z := \infty$ otherwise, satisfies therefore $\gr{Z} \subseteq A$, thus also $\se{Z &lt; \infty} \subseteq \pi(A).$</p>
<p>On the other hand, letting $n \to \infty$ in \eqref{eq_notsure}, we see that $\se{Z &lt; \infty}$ and $\pi(A)$ have the same probability. Therefore, the completeness of the probability space implies these two sets can be made equal.  $\square$</p>
